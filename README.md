# genetic-algorithm-optimization
 Genetic Algorithm (GA) is a common technique in Evolutionary Computation using to solve optimization problems. Last semester I created a GA to solve two dimension optimization problem f(x,y). The function is periodic, and the objective is to find a maximum of this function between [-1,2].
